2. What are the different states of the process?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Processes can be in one of three states: running, ready, or waiting.

The running state means that the process has all the resources it needs for execution and it has been given permission by the operating
system to use the processor.

Only one process can be in the running state at any given time. The remaining processes are either in a waiting state (i.e., waiting for
some external event to occur such as user input or disk access) or a ready state (i.e., waiting for permission to use the processor).

In a real operating system, the waiting and ready states are implemented as queues that hold the processes in these states.

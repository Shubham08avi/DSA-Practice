What are the benefits of multithreaded programming? 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Concurrency and Parallelism: Multithreaded programming enables the execution of multiple threads within a single process. This allows
   programs to perform multiple tasks concurrently, making better use of available processor cores and improving overall performance.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Improved Responsiveness: In applications with a graphical user interface (GUI), multithreading helps keep the user interface
   responsive. Time-consuming tasks can be offloaded to separate threads, preventing the UI from becoming unresponsive and providing a
   smoother user experience.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Resource Sharing: Threads within the same process can share data and resources more efficiently than separate processes. This can lead
   to reduced memory consumption and better communication between components.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Efficient Use of Resources: Modern processors often have multiple cores, and multithreading allows you to utilize these cores
   effectively, distributing the workload and potentially achieving better performance.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Task Decomposition: Multithreaded programming allows you to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable threads. This can
   lead to easier code maintenance and development.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Faster Execution: Certain tasks can be parallelized, meaning they can be divided into smaller subtasks that are executed concurrently.
   This can result in faster execution times for computationally intensive applications.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Scalability: Multithreading can enhance the scalability of applications. As hardware becomes more powerful, multithreaded programs can
   take advantage of additional processing resources without significant modifications.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Asynchronous Programming: Multithreading enables asynchronous programming, where tasks can proceed independently without waiting for
   one another to complete. This is particularly useful for I/O-bound operations, like reading/writing files or network communication.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Real-time Applications: Multithreading is crucial for developing real-time applications, where timely responses are required. Examples
   include multimedia applications, gaming, and control systems.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. Task-Level Parallelism: Different threads can work on different tasks simultaneously, leading to more efficient utilization of system
    resources and potentially faster completion of tasks.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Modularity and Maintainability: Multithreading can help organize code into separate threads for specific tasks or components, leading
    to a more modular and maintainable codebase.

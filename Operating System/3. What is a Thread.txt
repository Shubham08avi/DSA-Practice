3. What is a Thread?  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A thread is a single sequence stream within a process. Because threads have some of the properties of processes, they are sometimes 
called lightweight processes. 

Threads are a popular way to improve the application through parallelism. 

For example, in a browser, multiple tabs can be different threads. 

MS Word uses multiple threads, one thread to format the text, another thread to process inputs, etc.
